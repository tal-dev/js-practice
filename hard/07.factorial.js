/*
   Task Description:
   Write a function called "factorial" that takes a number as a parameter and returns the factorial of that number. A factorial is the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

   Example:
   var result1 = factorial(4);
   console.log(result1); // Output: 24 (4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24)

   var result2 = factorial(0);
   console.log(result2); // Output: 1 (0! is always equal to 1)
*/

function factorial(n) {
    //your code here
}
