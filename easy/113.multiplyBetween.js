/*
   Task Description:
   Write a function called "multiplyBetween".
   Given 2 integers, "multiplyBetween" returns the product between the two given integers,
   beginning at num1, and excluding num2.
   
   Notes:
   - The product between 1 and 4 is 1 * 2 * 3 = 6.
   - If num2 is not greater than num1, it should return 0.

   Example:
   var output = multiplyBetween(2, 5);
   console.log(output); // --> 24
*/

function multiplyBetween(num1, num2) {
    // your code here
}
