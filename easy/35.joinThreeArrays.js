   Task Description:
   Write a function called "joinThreeArrays" that takes three arrays, "arr1," "arr2," and "arr3," as input.

   followed by the elements of "arr2" in order, and then followed by the elements of "arr3" in order.

   Example:
    var output = joinThreeArrays([1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]);
    console.log(output); // --> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
*/

function joinThreeArrays(arr1, arr2, arr3) {
    // your code here
}
