/*
   Task Description:
   Write a function called "select" that takes an array and an object as input.

   "select" should return a new object whose properties are those in the given object AND whose keys are present in the given array.

   Notes:
   - If keys are present in the given array but are not in the given object, it should ignore them.
   - It does not modify the passed-in object.

   Example:
   var arr = ['a', 'c', 'e'];
   var obj = {
     a: 1,
     b: 2,
     c: 3,
     d: 4
   };
   var output = select(arr, obj);
   console.log(output); // should print { a: 1, c: 3 }
*/


function select(arr, obj) {
    // your code here
}
