/*
   Task Description:
   Write a function called "getIndexOf" that takes a character and a string as input.

   "getIndexOf" should return the first position (index) of the given character in the given string.

   Notes:
   - Strings are zero-indexed, meaning the first character in a string is at position 0.
   - When a string contains more than one occurrence of a character, it should return the index of its first occurrence.
   - If the character does not exist in the string, it should return -1.
   - Do not use the native indexOf function in your implementation.

function getIndexOf(char, str) {
    // your code here
