/*
   Task Description:
   Write a function called "removeEvenValues" that takes an object as input.

   "removeEvenValues" should remove any properties from the object whose values are even numbers.

   Do this in place and return the original object; do not construct a cloned object that omits the properties.

   Example:
   var obj = {
     a: 2,
     b: 3,
     c: 4
   };
   removeEvenValues(obj);

   After calling removeEvenValues, the object should be modified as follows:
   console.log(obj); // should print { b: 3 }
   
   Note: Remember, we are talking about any object, not just the one shown in the sample.
*/


function removeEvenValues(obj) {
    // your code here
}
