/*
   Task Description:
   Create a function "generateCoinChange(cents)" that accepts an amount in cents and computes and prints how to represent that amount with the smallest number of coins. The available coin denominations are pennies (1 cent), nickels (5 cents), dimes (10 cents), quarters (25 cents), half-dollars (50 cents), and dollars (100 cents).

   Example:
   generateCoinChange(194);

   Output:
   194 cents can be represented by:
   [
       dollars: 1,
       half-dollars: 1,
       quarters: 1,
       dimes: 1,
       nickels: 1,
       pennies: 4
   ]

   generateCoinChange(23);

   Output:
   23 cents can be represented by: [dimes: 2, pennies: 3]
