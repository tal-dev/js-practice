/*
   Task Description:
   Write a function called "calculateBillTotal" that takes a single argument - the pre tax and pre tip amount of a meal.

   "calculateBillTotal" should return the total amount due after adding sales tax and tip.

   Notes:
   - Assume that sales tax is 9.5%.
   - Assume that the tip should be calculated on the pre tip amount (i.e., before adding the tip).
   - Do NOT tip on the sales tax; only tip on the pre tip amount.

   Example:
   var output = calculateBillTotal(20);
   console.log(output); // should print 24.9
*/

function calculateBillTotal(preTaxAndTipAmount) {
    // your code here
}
