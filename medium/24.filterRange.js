/*
   Task Description:
   Write a JavaScript function called "filterRange" that accepts an array "arr" and two values "min" and "max" as parameters. 
   The function should retain only the values in the array that are between "min" and "max" (inclusive). 
   Work in-place, meaning you should return the modified array with the values in their original order.

   Example:
   var arr = [2, 6, 12, 4, 7, 13, 42, 1];
   filterRange(arr, 3, 9);
   console.log(arr); // Output: [6, 4, 7]
*/


function filterRange(arr, min, max) {
    // your code here
}
