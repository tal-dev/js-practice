/*
   Task Description:
   Write a function called "commonSuf" that accepts an array of words as input. It should return the largest suffix (word-end) that is common to all words in the array. If there is no common suffix, it should return an empty string.

   Example:
   var wordArray1 = ["deforestation", "citation", "conviction", "incarceration"];
   var result1 = commonSuf(wordArray1);
   console.log(result1); // Output: "tion"

   var wordArray2 = ["nice", "ice", "baby"];
   var result2 = commonSuf(wordArray2);
   console.log(result2); // Output: ""
*/

function commonSuf(arr) {
    // your code here
}
